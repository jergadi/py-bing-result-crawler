# py-bing-result-crawler
This is a Python (3) Spyder crawler project, that searches Bing.com and save the results to a csv file.
The script sends a url search to bing, and then go through the results one by one, and get the header and metadata. 
Note that this does not go inside the websites themselves, only the bing results information.

WHY BING? 
Bing is a search engine that has lesser security compared to Google and other popular search engines.
